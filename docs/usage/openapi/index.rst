OpenAPI
=======

Litestar has first class OpenAPI support offering the following features:

- Automatic `OpenAPI 3.1.0 Schema <https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.1.0>`_ generation, which is available as both YAML
  and JSON.
- Builtin support for static documentation site generation using several different libraries.
- Simple configuration using pydantic based classes.


Litestar includes a complete implementation of the `latest version of the OpenAPI specification <https://spec.openapis.org/oas/latest.html>`_
using Python dataclasses. This implementation is used as a basis for generating OpenAPI specs, supporting builtins including
`dataclasses` and `TypedDict`, as well as Pydantic models and any 3rd party entities for which a plugin is implemented.

This is also highly configurable - and users can customize the OpenAPI spec in a variety of ways - ranging from passing
configuration globally, to settings specific kwargs on route handler decorators.
