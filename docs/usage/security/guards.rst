Guards
======

Guards are :term:`callables <python:callable>` that receive two arguments - ``connection``, which is the
:class:`~.connection.ASGIConnection` instance, and ``route_handler``, which is a copy of the
:class:`~.handlers.BaseRouteHandler`. Their role is to *authorize* the request by verifying that
the connection is allowed to reach the endpoint handler in question. If verification fails, the guard should raise an
:exc:`HTTPException`, usually a :class:`~.exceptions.NotAuthorizedException` with a
``status_code`` of ``401``.

To illustrate this we will implement a rudimentary role based authorization system in our Litestar app. As we have done
for ``authentication``, we will assume that we added some sort of persistence layer without actually specifying it in
the example.

We begin by creating an :class:`~enum.Enum` with two roles - ``consumer`` and ``admin``:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/guards/enum.py
    :caption: Defining the UserRole enum
    :language: python


Our ``User`` model will now look like this:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/guards/model.py
    :caption: User model for role based authorization
    :language: python


Given that the ``User`` model has a ``role`` property we can use it to authorize a request.
Let us create a guard that only allows admin users to access certain route handlers and then add it to a route
handler function:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/guards/guard.py
    :caption: Defining the ``admin_user_guard`` guard used to authorize certain route handlers
    :language: python


Thus, only an admin user would be able to send a post request to the ``create_user`` handler.

Guard scopes
------------

Guards are part of Litestar's :ref:`layered architecture <usage/applications:layered architecture>` and can be declared
on all layers of the app - the Litestar instance, routers, controllers, and individual route handlers:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/guards/guard_scope.py
    :caption: Declaring guards on different layers of the app
    :language: python


The placement of guards within the Litestar application depends on the scope and level of access control needed:

- Should restrictions apply to individual route handlers?
- Is the access control intended for all actions within a controller?
- Are you aiming to secure all routes managed by a specific router?
- Or do you need to enforce access control across the entire application?

As you can see in the above examples - ``guards`` is a :class:`list`. This means you can add **multiple** guards at
every layer. Unlike :doc:`dependencies </usage/dependency-injection>` , guards do not override each other but are
rather *cumulative*. This means that you can define guards on different layers of your app, and they will combine.

.. caution::

    If guards are placed at the controller or the app level, they **will** be executed on all ``OPTIONS`` requests as well.

The route handler "opt" key
---------------------------

Occasionally there might be a need to set some values on the route handler itself - these can be permissions, or some
other flag. This can be achieved with :ref:`the opts kwarg <handler_opts>` of route handler

To illustrate this let us say we want to have an endpoint that is guarded by a "secret" token, to which end we create
the following guard:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/guards/route_handler.py
    :language: python
