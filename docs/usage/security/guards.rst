Guards
======

Guards are :term:`callables <python:callable>` that receive two arguments - ``connection``, which is the :class:`Request <.connection.Request>` or :class:`WebSocket <.connection.WebSocket>` instance (both sub-classes of :class:`~.connection.ASGIConnection`), and ``route_handler``, which is a copy of the
:class:`~.handlers.BaseRouteHandler`. Their role is to *authorize* the request by verifying that
the connection is allowed to reach the endpoint handler in question. If verification fails, the guard should raise an
:exc:`HTTPException`, usually a :class:`~.exceptions.NotAuthorizedException` with a
``status_code`` of ``401``.

To illustrate this we will implement a rudimentary role based authorization system in our Litestar app. As we have done
for ``authentication``, we will assume that we added some sort of persistence layer without actually specifying it in
the example.

We begin by creating an :class:`~enum.Enum` with two roles - ``consumer`` and ``admin``:

.. code-block:: python
    :caption: Defining the UserRole enum

    from enum import Enum


    class UserRole(str, Enum):
       CONSUMER = "consumer"
       ADMIN = "admin"

Our ``User`` model will now look like this:

.. dropdown:: Click to toggle the model ``User``

    .. code-block:: python
        :caption: User model for role based authorization

        from pydantic import BaseModel, UUID4
        from enum import Enum


        class UserRole(str, Enum):
           CONSUMER = "consumer"
           ADMIN = "admin"


        class User(BaseModel):
           id: UUID4
           role: UserRole

           @property
           def is_admin(self) -> bool:
               """Determines whether the user is an admin user"""
               return self.role == UserRole.ADMIN

Given that the ``User`` model has a ``role`` property we can use it to authorize a request.
Let us create a guard that only allows admin users to access certain route handlers and then add it to a route
handler function:

.. dropdown:: Click to toggle the guard ``admin_user_guard``

    .. code-block:: python
        :caption: Defining the ``admin_user_guard`` guard used to authorize certain route handlers

        from enum import Enum

        from pydantic import BaseModel, UUID4
        from litestar import post
        from litestar.connection import ASGIConnection
        from litestar.exceptions import NotAuthorizedException
        from litestar.handlers.base import BaseRouteHandler


        class UserRole(str, Enum):
           CONSUMER = "consumer"
           ADMIN = "admin"


        class User(BaseModel):
           id: UUID4
           role: UserRole

           @property
           def is_admin(self) -> bool:
               """Determines whether the user is an admin user"""
               return self.role == UserRole.ADMIN


        def admin_user_guard(connection: ASGIConnection, _: BaseRouteHandler) -> None:
           if not connection.user.is_admin:
               raise NotAuthorizedException()


        @post(path="/user", guards=[admin_user_guard])
        def create_user(data: User) -> User: ...

Thus, only an admin user would be able to send a post request to the ``create_user`` handler.

Guard scopes
------------

Guards are part of Litestar's :ref:`layered architecture <usage/applications:layered architecture>` and can be declared
on all layers of the app - the Litestar instance, routers, controllers, and individual route handlers:

.. dropdown:: Example of declaring guards on different layers of the app

    .. code-block:: python
        :caption: Declaring guards on different layers of the app

        from litestar import Controller, Router, Litestar
        from litestar.connection import ASGIConnection
        from litestar.handlers.base import BaseRouteHandler


        def my_guard(connection: ASGIConnection, handler: BaseRouteHandler) -> None: ...


        # controller
        class UserController(Controller):
           path = "/user"
           guards = [my_guard]

           ...


        # router
        admin_router = Router(path="admin", route_handlers=[UserController], guards=[my_guard])

        # app
        app = Litestar(route_handlers=[admin_router], guards=[my_guard])

The placement of guards within the Litestar application depends on the scope and level of access control needed:

- Should restrictions apply to individual route handlers?
- Is the access control intended for all actions within a controller?
- Are you aiming to secure all routes managed by a specific router?
- Or do you need to enforce access control across the entire application?

As you can see in the above examples - ``guards`` is a :class:`list`. This means you can add **multiple** guards at
every layer. Unlike :doc:`dependencies </usage/dependency-injection>` , guards do not override each other but are
rather *cumulative*. This means that you can define guards on different layers of your app, and they will combine.

.. caution::

    If guards are placed at the controller or the app level, they **will** be executed on all ``OPTIONS`` requests as well.
    For more details, including a workaround, refer https://github.com/litestar-org/litestar/issues/2314.


The route handler "opt" key
---------------------------

Occasionally there might be a need to set some values on the route handler itself - these can be permissions, or some
other flag. This can be achieved with :ref:`the opts kwarg <handler_opts>` of route handler

To illustrate this let us say we want to have an endpoint that is guarded by a "secret" token, to which end we create
the following guard:

.. code-block:: python

   from litestar import get
   from litestar.exceptions import NotAuthorizedException
   from litestar.connection import ASGIConnection
   from litestar.handlers.base import BaseRouteHandler
   from os import environ


   def secret_token_guard(
       connection: ASGIConnection, route_handler: BaseRouteHandler
   ) -> None:
       if (
           route_handler.opt.get("secret")
           and not connection.headers.get("Secret-Header", "")
           == route_handler.opt["secret"]
       ):
           raise NotAuthorizedException()


   @get(path="/secret", guards=[secret_token_guard], opt={"secret": environ.get("SECRET")})
   def secret_endpoint() -> None: ...
