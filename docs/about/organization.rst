Organization
============

Starlite is developed by a group of volunteers and outside contributors, and lead by a
team of `Maintainers`_.

From its inception, Starlite was envisaged as a community driven project. We encourage
users to become involved with the project - feel free to open issues, chime in on
discussions, review pull requests and of course - contribute code.

Every contribution is welcome and appreciated, which is why we follow the
`All Contributors <https://allcontributors.org/>`_ guideline to recognise all of them -
Including those that don't push code.

Structure
----------

The organizational structure is very much flat, with only two distinctive roles:

- `Members <https://github.com/orgs/starlite-api/people>`_: People who have contributed
  significantly and have been granted limited administrative permissions to the Starlite
  organization
- `Maintainers`_: Long term members of the organization who have demonstrated a vested
  interest in developing and maintaining Starlite and its related projects, contributing
  significantly in administrative and development tasks


Maintainers
+++++++++++

Current maintainers of the project are:

- Na'aman Hirschfeld (`@goldziher <https://github.com/Goldziher>`_)
- Peter Schutt (`@peterschutt <https://github.com/peterschutt>`_)
- Cody Fincher (`@cofin <https://github.com/cofin>`_)
- Janek Nouvertné (`@provinzkraut <https://github.com/provinzkraut>`_)
- Konstantin Mikhailov (`@jtraub <https://github.com/jtraub>`_)

New maintainers may be nominated by any member of the Starlite organization and have to
be approved unanimously by the current maintainers.
