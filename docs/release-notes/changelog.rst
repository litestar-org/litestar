2.x Changelog
=============

.. changelog:: 2.2.0
    :date: 2023/10/12

    .. change:: Fix implicit conversion of objects to ``bool`` in debug response
        :type: bugfix
        :pr: 2384
        :issue: 2381

        The exception handler middleware would, when in debug mode, implicitly call an
        object's :meth:`__bool__ <object.__bool__>`, which would lead to errors if that
        object overloaded the operator, for example if the object in question was a
        SQLAlchemy element.

    .. change:: Correctly re-export filters and exceptions from ``advanced-alchemy``
        :type: bugfix
        :pr: 2360
        :issue: 2358

        Some re-exports of filter and exception types from ``advanced-alchemy`` were
        missing, causing various issues when ``advanced-alchemy`` was installed, but
        Litestar would still use its own version of these classes.

    .. change:: Re-add ``create_engine`` method to SQLAlchemy configs
        :type: bugfix
        :pr: 2382

        The ``create_engine`` method was removed in an ``advanced-alchemy`` releases.
        This was addresses by re-adding it to the versions provided by Litestar.

    .. change:: Fix ``before_request`` modifies route handler signature
        :type: bugfix
        :pr: 2391
        :issue: 2368

        The ``before_request`` would modify the return annotation of associated
        route handlers to conform with its own return type annotation, which would cause
        issues and unexpected behaviour when that annotation was not compatible with the
        original one.

        This was fixed by not having the ``before_request`` handler modify the
        route handler's signature. Users are now expected to ensure that values returned
        from a ``before_request`` handler conform to the return type annotation of the
        route handler.

    .. change:: Ensure compression is applied before caching when using compression middleware
        :type: bugfix
        :pr: 2393
        :issue: 1301

        A previous limitation was removed that would apply compression from the
        :class:`~litestar.middleware.compression.CompressionMiddleware` only *after* a
        response was restored from the cache, resulting in unnecessary repeated
        computation and increased size of the stored response.

        This was due to caching being handled on the response layer, where a response
        object would be pickled, restored upon a cache hit and then re-sent, including
        all middlewares.

        The new implementation now instead applies caching on the ASGI level; Individual
        messages sent to the ``send`` callable are cached, and later re-sent. This
        process ensures that the compression middleware has been applied before, and
        will be skipped when re-sending a cached response.

        In addition, this increases performance and reduces storage size even in cases
        where no compression is applied because the slow and inefficient pickle format
        can be avoided.

    .. change:: Fix implicit JSON parsing of URL encoded data
        :type: bugfix
        :pr: 2394

        A process was removed where Litestar would implicitly attempt to parse parts of
        URL encoded data as JSON. This was originally added to provide some performance
        boosts when that data was in fact meant to be JSON, but turned out to be too
        fragile.

        Regular data conversion / validation is unaffected by this.

    .. change:: CLI enabled by default
        :type: feature
        :pr: 2346
        :issue: 2318

        The CLI and all its dependencies are now included by default, to enable a better
        and more consistent developer experience out of the box.

        The previous ``litestar[cli]`` extra is still available for backwards
        compatibility, but as of ``2.2.0`` it is without effect.

    .. change:: Customization of Pydantic integration via ``PydanticPlugin``
        :type: feature
        :pr: 2404
        :issue: 2373

        A new :class:`~litestar.contrib.pydantic.PydanticPlugin` has been added, which
        can be used to configure Pydantic behaviour. Currently it supports setting a
        ``prefer_alias`` option, which will pass the ``by_alias=True`` flag to Pydantic
        when exporting models, as well as generate schemas accordingly.

    .. change:: Add ``/schema/openapi.yml`` to the available schema paths
        :type: feature
        :pr: 2411

        The YAML version of the OpenAPI schema is now available under
        ``/schema/openapi.yml`` in addition to ``/schema/openapi.yaml``.

    .. change:: Add experimental DTO codegen backend
        :type: feature
        :pr: 2388

        A new DTO backend was introduced which speeds up the transfer process by
        generating optimized Python code ahead of time. Testing shows that the new
        backend is between 2.5 and 5 times faster depending on the operation and data
        provided.

        The new backend can be enabled globally for all DTOs by passing the appropriate
        feature flag to the Litestar application:

        .. code-block:: python

            from litestar import Litestar
            from litestar.config.app import ExperimentalFeatures

            app = Litestar(experimental_features=[ExperimentalFeatures.DTO_CODEGEN])

        .. seealso::
            For more information see
            :ref:`usage/dto/0-basic-use:Improving performance with the codegen backend`


    .. change:: Improved error messages for missing required parameters
        :type: feature
        :pr: 2418

        Error messages for missing required parameters will now also contain the source
        of the expected parameter:

        Before:

        .. code-block:: json

            {
              "status_code": 400,
              "detail": "Missing required parameter foo for url http://testerver.local"
            }


        After:

        .. code-block:: json

            {
              "status_code": 400,
              "detail": "Missing required header parameter 'foo' for url http://testerver.local"
            }


.. changelog:: 2.1.1
    :date: 2023/09/24

    .. change:: Fix ``DeprecationWarning`` raised by ``Response.to_asgi_response``
        :type: bugfix
        :pr: 2364

        :meth:`~litestar.response.Response.to_asgi_response` was passing a
        non-:obj:`None` default value (``[]``) to ``ASGIResponse`` for
        ``encoded_headers``, resulting in a :exc:`DeprecationWarning` being raised.
        This was fixed by leaving the default value as :obj:`None`.


.. changelog:: 2.1.0

    .. change:: Make ``302`` the default ``status_code`` for redirect responses
        :type: feature
        :pr: 2189
        :issue: 2138

        Make ``302`` the default ``status_code`` for redirect responses

    .. change:: Add :meth:`include_in_schema` option for all layers
        :type: feature
        :pr: 2295
        :issue: 2267

        Adds the :meth:`include_in_schema` option to all layers, allowing to include/exclude
        specific routes from the generated OpenAPI schema.

    .. change:: Deprecate parameter ``app`` of ``Response.to_asgi_response``
        :type: feature
        :pr: 2268
        :issue: 2217

        Adds deprecation warning for unused ``app`` parameter of ``to_asgi_response`` as
        it is unused and redundant due to ``request.app`` being available.

    .. change:: Authentication: Add parameters to set the JWT ``extras`` field
        :type: feature
        :pr: 2313

        Adds ``token_extras`` to both :func:`BaseJWTAuth.login` and :meth:`BaseJWTAuth.create_token` methods,
        to allow the definition of the ``extras`` JWT field.

    .. change:: Templating: Add possibility to customize Jinja environment
        :type: feature
        :pr: 2195
        :issue: 965

        Adds the ability to pass a custom Jinja2 ``Environment`` or Mako ``TemplateLookup`` by providing a
        dedicated class method.

    .. change:: Add support for `minjinja <https://github.com/mitsuhiko/minijinja>`_
        :type: feature
        :pr: 2250

        Adds support for MiniJinja, a minimal Jinja2 implementation.

        .. seealso:: :doc:`/usage/templating`

    .. change:: SQLAlchemy: Exclude implicit fields for SQLAlchemy DTO
        :type: feature
        :pr: 2170

        :class:`SQLAlchemyDTO (Advanced Alchemy) <advanced_alchemy.extensions.litestar.dto.SQLAlchemyDTO>` can now be
        configured using a separate config object. This can be set using both
        class inheritance and `Annotated <https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Annotated>`_:

        .. code-block:: python
            :caption: :class:`SQLAlchemyDTO (Advanced Alchemy) <advanced_alchemy.extensions.litestar.dto.SQLAlchemyDTO>` can now be configured using a separate config object using ``config`` object.

            class MyModelDTO(SQLAlchemyDTO[MyModel]):
                config = SQLAlchemyDTOConfig()

        or

        .. code-block:: python
            :caption: :class:`SQLAlchemyDTO (Advanced Alchemy) <advanced_alchemy.extensions.litestar.dto.SQLAlchemyDTO>` can now be configured using a separate config object using ``Annotated``.

             MyModelDTO = SQLAlchemyDTO[Annotated[MyModel, SQLAlchemyDTOConfig()]]

        The new configuration currently accepts a single attribute which is ``include_implicit_fields`` that has
        a default value of ``True``. If set to to ``False``, all implicitly mapped columns will be hidden
        from the ``DTO``. If set to ``hybrid-only``, then hybrid properties will be shown but not other
        implicit columns.

        Finally, implicit columns that are marked with ``Mark.READ_ONLY`` or ``Mark.WRITE_ONLY``
        will always be shown regardless of the value of ``include_implicit_fields``.

    .. change:: SQLAlchemy: Allow repository functions to be filtered by expressions
        :type: feature
        :pr: 2265

        Enhances the SQLALchemy repository so that you can more easily pass in complex ``where`` expressions into the repository functions.

        .. tip:: Without this, you have to override the ``statement`` parameter and it separates the where conditions from the filters and the ``kwargs``.

        Allows usage of this syntax:

        .. code-block:: python

            locations, total_count = await model_service.list_and_count(
                ST_DWithin(UniqueLocation.location, geog, 1000), account_id=str(account_id)
            )

        instead of the previous method of overriding the ``statement``:

        .. code-block:: python

            locations, total_count = await model_service.list_and_count(
                statement=select(Model).where(ST_DWithin(UniqueLocation.location, geog, 1000)),
                account_id=str(account_id),
            )

    .. change:: SQLAlchemy: Use :func:`lambda_stmt <sqlalchemy.sql.expression.lambda_stmt>` in the repository
        :type: feature
        :pr: 2179

        Converts the repository to use :func:`lambda_stmt <sqlalchemy.sql.expression.lambda_stmt>`
        instead of the normal ``select``

    .. change:: SQLAlchemy: Swap to the `advanced_alchemy <https://docs.advanced-alchemy.jolt.rs>`_ implementations
        :type: feature
        :pr: 2312

        Swaps the internal SQLAlchemy repository to use the external
        `advanced_alchemy <https://docs.advanced-alchemy.jolt.rs>`_ library implementations

    .. change:: Remove usages of deprecated ``ExceptionHandlerMiddleware`` ``debug`` parameter
        :type: bugfix
        :pr: 2192

        Removes leftover usages of deprecated ``ExceptionHandlerMiddleware`` debug parameter.

    .. change:: DTOs: Raise :class:`ValidationException` when Pydantic validation fails
        :type: bugfix
        :pr: 2204
        :issue: 2190

         Ensures that when the Pydantic validation fails in the Pydantic DTO,
         a :class:`ValidationException` is raised with the extras set to the errors given by Pydantic.

    .. change:: Set the max width of the console to 80
        :type: bugfix
        :pr: 2244

        Sets the max width of the console to 80, to prevent the output from being
        wrapped.

    .. change:: Handling of optional path parameters
        :type: bugfix
        :pr: 2224
        :issue: 2222

        Resolves an issue where optional path parameters caused a 500 error to be raised.

    .. change:: Use os.replace instead of shutil.move for renaming files
        :type: bugfix
        :pr: 2223

        Change to using :func:`os.replace` instead of :func:`shutil.move` for renaming files, to
        ensure atomicity.

    .. change:: Exception detail attribute
        :type: bugfix
        :pr: 2231

        Set correctly the detail attribute on :class:`LitestarException` and :class:`HTTPException`
        regardless of whether it's passed positionally or by name.

    .. change:: Filters not available in ``exists()``
        :type: bugfix
        :pr: 2228
        :issue: 2221

        Fixes :meth:`exists` method for SQLAlchemy sync and async.

    .. change:: Add Pydantic types to SQLAlchemy registry only if Pydantic is installed
        :type: bugfix
        :pr: 2252

        Allows importing from ``litestar.contrib.sqlalchemy.base`` even if Pydantic is not installed.

    .. change:: Don't add content type for responses that don't have a body
        :type: bugfix
        :pr: 2263
        :issue: 2106

        Ensures that the ``content-type`` header is not added for responses that do not have a
        body such as responses with status code ``204 (No Content)``.

    .. change:: ``SQLAlchemyPlugin`` refactored
        :type: bugfix
        :pr: 2269

        Changes the way the ``SQLAlchemyPlugin`` to now append the other plugins instead of the
        inheritance that was previously used. This makes using the ``plugins.get`` function work as expected.

    .. change:: Ensure ``app-dir`` is appended to path during autodiscovery
        :type: bugfix
        :pr: 2277
        :issue: 2266

        Fixes a bug which caused the ``--app-dir`` option to the Litestar CLI to not be propagated during autodiscovery.

    .. change:: Set content length header by default
        :type: bugfix
        :pr: 2271

        Sets the ``content-length`` header by default even if the length of the body is ``0``.

    .. change:: Incorrect handling of mutable headers in :class:`ASGIResponse`
        :type: bugfix
        :pr: 2308
        :issue: 2196

        Update :class:`ASGIResponse`, :class:`Response` and friends to address a few issues related to headers:

        - If ``encoded_headers`` were passed in at any point, they were mutated within responses, leading to a growing list of headers with every response
        - While mutating ``encoded_headers``, the checks performed to assert a value was (not) already present, headers were not treated case-insensitive
        - Unnecessary work was performed while converting cookies / headers into an encoded headers list

        This was fixed by:

        - Removing the use of and deprecate ``encoded_headers``
        - Handling headers on :class:`ASGIResponse` with :class:`MutableScopeHeaders`, which allows for case-insensitive membership tests, ``.setdefault`` operations, etc.

    .. change:: Adds missing ORM registry export
        :type: bugfix
        :pr: 2316

        Adds an export that was overlooked for the base repo

    .. change:: Discrepancy in ``attrs``, ``msgspec`` and ``Pydantic`` for multi-part forms
        :type: bugfix
        :pr: 2280
        :issue: 2278

        Resolves issue in ``attrs``, ``msgspec`` and Pydantic for multi-part forms

    .. change:: Set proper default for ``exclude_http_methods`` in auth middleware
        :type: bugfix
        :pr: 2325
        :issue: 2205

        Sets ``OPTIONS`` as the default value for ``exclude_http_methods`` in the base authentication middleware class.

.. changelog:: 2.0.0
    :date: 2023/08/19

    .. change:: Regression | Missing ``media_type`` information to error responses
        :type: bugfix
        :pr: 2131
        :issue: 2024

        Fixed a regression that caused error responses to be sent using a mismatched
        media type, e.g. an error response from a ``text/html`` endpoint would be sent
        as JSON.

    .. change:: Regression | ``Litestar.debug`` does not propagate to exception handling middleware
        :type: bugfix
        :pr: 2153
        :issue: 2147

        Fixed a regression where setting ``Litestar.debug`` would not propagate to the
        exception handler middleware, resulting in exception responses always being sent
        using the initial debug value.

    .. change:: Static files not being served if a route handler with the same base path was registered
        :type: bugfix
        :pr: 2154

        Fixed a bug that would result in a ``404 - Not Found`` when requesting a static
        file where the :attr:`~litestar.static_files.StaticFilesConfig.path` was also
        used by a route handler.

    .. change:: HTMX: Missing default values for ``receive`` and ``send`` parameters of ``HTMXRequest``
        :type: bugfix
        :pr: 2145

        Add missing default values for the ``receive`` and ``send`` parameters of
        :class:`~litestar.contrib.htmx.request.HTMXRequest`.

    .. change:: DTO: Excluded attributes accessed during transfer
        :type: bugfix
        :pr: 2127
        :issue: 2125

        Fix the behaviour of DTOs such that they will no longer access fields that have
        been included. This behaviour would previously cause issues when these
        attributes were either costly or impossible to access (e.g. lazy loaded
        relationships of a SQLAlchemy model).

    .. change:: DTO | Regression: ``DTOData.create_instance`` ignores renaming
        :type: bugfix
        :pr: 2144

        Fix a regression where calling
        :meth:`~litestar.dto.data_structures.DTOData.create_instance` would ignore the
        renaming settings of fields.

    .. change:: OpenAPI | Regression: Response schema for files and streams set ``application/octet-stream`` as ``contentEncoding`` instead of ``contentMediaType``
        :type: bugfix
        :pr: 2130

        Fix a regression that would set ``application/octet-stream`` as the ``contentEncoding``
        instead of ``contentMediaType`` in the response schema of
        :class:`~litestar.response.File` :class:`~litestar.response.Stream`.

    .. change:: OpenAPI | Regression: Response schema diverges from ``prefer_alias`` setting for Pydantic models
        :type: bugfix
        :pr: 2150

        Fix a regression that made the response schema use ``prefer_alias=True``,
        diverging from how Pydantic models are exported by default.

    .. change:: OpenAPI | Regression: Examples not being generated deterministically
        :type: bugfix
        :pr: 2161

        Fix a regression that made generated examples non-deterministic, caused by a
        misconfiguration of the random seeding.

    .. change:: SQLAlchemy repository: Handling of dialects not supporting JSON
        :type: bugfix
        :pr: 2139
        :issue: 2137

        Fix a bug where SQLAlchemy would raise a :exc:`TypeError` when using a dialect
        that does not support JSON with the SQLAlchemy repositories.

    .. change:: JWT | Regression: ``OPTIONS`` and ``HEAD`` being authenticated by default
        :type: bugfix
        :pr: 2160

        Fix a regression that would make
        :class:`~litestar.contrib.jwt.JWTAuthenticationMiddleware` authenticate
        ``OPTIONS`` and ``HEAD`` requests by default.

    .. change:: SessionAuth | Regression: ``OPTIONS`` and ``HEAD`` being authenticated by default
        :type: bugfix
        :pr: 2182

        Fix a regression that would make
        :class:`~litestar.security.session_auth.middleware.SessionAuthMiddleware` authenticate
        ``OPTIONS`` and ``HEAD`` requests by default.

.. changelog:: 2.0.0rc1
    :date: 2023/08/05

    .. change:: Support for server-sent-events
        :type: feature
        :pr: 2035
        :issue: 1185

        Support for `Server-sent events <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events>` has been
        added with the :class:`ServerSentEvent <.response.ServerSentEvent>`:

        .. code-block:: python

            async def my_generator() -> AsyncGenerator[bytes, None]:
                count = 0
                while count < 10:
                    await sleep(0.01)
                    count += 1
                    yield str(count)


            @get(path="/count")
            def sse_handler() -> ServerSentEvent:
                return ServerSentEvent(my_generator())

        .. seealso::
            :ref:`Server Sent Events <usage/responses:Server Sent Event Responses>`


    .. change:: SQLAlchemy repository: allow specifying ``id_attribute`` per method
        :type: feature
        :pr: 2052

        The following methods now accept an ``id_attribute`` argument, allowing to
        specify an alternative value to the models primary key:

        - ``~litestar.contrib.sqlalchemy.repository.SQLAlchemyAsyncRepository.delete``
        - ``~litestar.contrib.sqlalchemy.repository.SQLAlchemyAsyncRepository.delete_many``
        - ``~litestar.contrib.sqlalchemy.repository.SQLAlchemyAsyncRepository.get``

        A workaround for a
        `bug in poetry <https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry/issues/4401>`_ that
        caused development / extra dependencies to be installed alongside the package
        has been added.

    :date: 2023/07/20

    .. change:: :class:`SQLAlchemyDTO (Advanced Alchemy) <advanced_alchemy.extensions.litestar.dto.SQLAlchemyDTO>`: column/relationship type inference
        :type: feature
        :pr: 1879
        :issue: 1853

        If type annotations aren't available for a given column/relationship, they may
        be inferred from the mapped object.

        For columns, the :attr:`~sqlalchemy.engine.interfaces.ReflectedColumn.type`\ 's
        :attr:`~sqlalchemy.types.TypeEngine.python_type` will be used as the type of the
        column, and the :attr:`~sqlalchemy.engine.interfaces.ReflectedColumn.nullable`
        property to determine if the field should have a :obj:`None` union.

        For relationships, where the ``RelationshipProperty.direction`` is
        :attr:`~sqlalchemy.orm.RelationshipDirection.ONETOMANY` or
        :attr:`~sqlalchemy.orm.RelationshipDirection.MANYTOMANY`,
        ``RelationshipProperty.collection_class`` and
        ``RelationshipProperty.mapper.class_`` are used to construct an annotation for
        the collection.

        For one-to-one relationships, ``RelationshipProperty.mapper.class_`` is used to
        get the type annotation, and will be made a union with :obj:`None` if all of the
        foreign key columns are nullable.

    .. change:: DTO: Piccolo ORM
        :type: feature
        :pr: 1896

        Add support for piccolo ORM with the

    .. change:: OpenAPI: Allow setting ``OpenAPIController.path`` from ```OpenAPIConfig``
        :type: feature
        :pr: 1886

        :attr:`~litestar.openapi.OpenAPIConfig.path` has been added, which can be used
        to set the ``path`` for :class:`~litestar.openapi.OpenAPIController` directly,
        without needing to create a custom instance of it.

        If ``path`` is set in both :class:`~litestar.openapi.OpenAPIConfig` and
        :class:`~litestar.openapi.OpenAPIController`, the path set on the controller
        will take precedence.

            (and their sync equivalents)

        ``auto_refresh``
            When :obj:`True`, the session will execute

    .. change:: Include path name in ``ImproperlyConfiguredException`` message for missing param types
        :type: feature
        :pr: 1935

        The message of a :exc:`ImproperlyConfiguredException` raised when a path
        parameter is missing a type now contains the name of the path.

        :attr:`~litestar.dto.config.DTOConfig.exclude`.

        If ``include`` is provided, only those fields specified within it will be
        included.

    .. change:: ``AbstractDTOFactory`` moved to ``dto.factory.base``

        :pr: 1933


        The ``_sentinel`` column of
        ``~litestar.contrib.sqlalchemy.base.UUIDPrimaryKey`` has been renamed to
        ``sa_orm_sentinel``, to support Spanner, which does not support tables starting
        with ``_``.

    .. change:: SQLAlchemy repository: Fix audit columns defaulting to app startup time
        :type: bugfix
        :pr: 1894

        A bug was fixed where
        ``~litestar.contrib.sqlalchemy.base.AuditColumns.created_at`` and
        ``~litestar.contrib.sqlalchemy.base.AuditColumns.updated_at`` would default
        to the :class:`~datetime.datetime` at initialization time, instead of the time
        of the update.

        :type: bugfix

        :issue: 1851

        Fixes handling of columns defined with
        `Sequence <https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/20/core/defaults.html#defining-sequences>`_
        default values.

        The SQLAlchemy default value for a :class:`~sqlalchemy.schema.Column` will be
        ignored when it is a :class:`~sqlalchemy.schema.Sequence` object. This is
        because the SQLAlchemy sequence types represent server generated values, and
        there is no way for us to generate a reasonable default value for that field
        from it without making a database query, which is not possible deserialization.

    .. change:: Allow JSON as redirect response
        :type: bugfix

        A bug was fixed that would lead to fields of a Pydantic model or msgspec Structs
        being marked as "not required" in the generated OpenAPI schema when used with
        DTOs.

    .. change:: Replace ``Header``, ``CacheControlHeader`` and ``ETag`` Pydantic models with dataclasses
        :type: misc
        :pr: 1917

        :class:`~litestar.datastructures.CacheControlHeader` and
        :class:`~litestar.datastructures.ETag` have been replaced with dataclasses.


        .. note::
            Although marked breaking, this change should not affect usage unless you
            relied on these being Pydantic models in some way.

    .. change:: Pydantic as an optional dependency
        :breaking:
        :pr: 1963
        :type: misc

        As of this release, Pydantic is no longer a required dependency of Litestar.
        It is still supported in the same capacity as before, but Litestar itself does
        not depend on it anymore in its internals.

    .. change:: Pydantic 2 support

    .. change:: SQLAlchemy DTO: Explicit error messages when type annotations for a column are missing
        :type: feature
        :pr: 1852

        Replace the nondescript :exc:`KeyError` raised when a SQLAlchemy DTO is
        constructed from a model that is missing a type annotation for an included
        column with an :exc:`ImproperlyConfiguredException`, including an explicit error

        :type: feature
        :pr: 1742

        - A new ``pdb_on_exception`` parameter was added to
          :class:`~litestar.app.Litestar`. When set to ``True``, Litestar will drop into
          a the Python debugger when an exception occurs. It defaults to ``None``
        - When ``pdb_on_exception`` is ``None``, setting the environment variable

        ``litestar.contrib.sqlalchemy.repository.SQLAlchemySyncRepository``,
        which offer the same functionality as its asynchronous counterpart while
        operating on a synchronous :class:`sqlalchemy.orm.Session`.

        When exporting models using the

        DTOs can now be wrapped in generic collection types such as

        When a handler returns a type that is not supported by the DTO, but:

        - the return type is generic
        - it has a generic type argument that is supported by the dto
        - the type argument maps to an attribute on the return type

        the DTO operations will be performed on the data retrieved from that attribute
        of the instance returned from the handler, and return the instance.

        The constraints are:

        - the type returned from the handler must be a type that litestar can
          natively encode
        - the annotation of the attribute that holds the data must be a type that DTOs

        :issue: 1674
        :pr: 1678

        App state can be created using ``deep_copy=False``, however state would still be

        When :class:`~litestar.typing.ParsedType` was introduced,
        :meth:`~litestar.typing.ParsedType.is_subclass_of` any union was deliberately
        left to return ``False`` with the intention of waiting for some use-cases to
        arrive.

        This behaviour was changed to address an issue where a handler may be typed to
        return a union of multiple response types; If all response types are
        :class:`~litestar.response.Response` subtypes then the correct response handler
        will now be applied.

        Migrations generated for models with a

        ``length=16`` on the input.  Since this parameter is not defined in the type's
        the ``__init__`` method. This was fixed by adding the appropriate parameter to
        the type's signature.

    .. change:: Deprecation of ``Litestar`` parameter ``preferred_validation_backend``
        :pr: 1810
        :breaking:

        The following changes have been made regarding the
        ``preferred_validation_backend``:

        - The ``preferred_validation_backend`` parameter of
          :class:`~litestar.app.Litestar` has been renamed to
          ``_preferred_validation_backend`` and deprecated. It will be removed
          completely in a future version.
        - The ``Litestar.preferred_validation_backend`` attribute has been made private
        - The ``preferred_validation_backend`` attribute has been removed from
          :class:`~litestar.config.app.AppConfig`

        In addition, the logic for selecting a signature validation backend has been
        simplified as follows: If the preferred backend is set to ``attrs``, or the
        signature contains attrs types, ``attrs`` is selected. In all other cases,
        Pydantic will be used.

    .. change:: ``Response.get_serializer`` moved to ``serialization.get_serializer``
        :pr: 1820
        :breaking:


        The ``Response.get_serializer()`` method has been removed in favor of the
        :func:`~litestar.serialization.get_serializer` function.

        In the previous :class:`~litestar.response.Response` implementation,
        ``get_serializer()`` was called on the response inside the response's
        ``__init__``, and the merging of class-level ``type_encoders`` with the
        ``Response``\ 's ``type_encoders`` occurred inside its ``get_serializer``
        method.

        In the current version of ``Response``, the response body is not encoded until
        after the response object has been returned from the handler, and it is
        converted into a low-level :class:`~litestar.response.base.ASGIResponse` object.
        Due to this, there is still opportunity for the handler layer resolved
        ``type_encoders`` object to be merged with the ``Response`` defined
        ``type_encoders``, making the merge inside the ``Response`` no longer necessary.

        In addition, the separate ``get_serializer`` function greatly simplifies the
        interaction between middlewares and serializers, allowing to retrieve one
        independently from a ``Response``.

    .. change:: Remove response containers and introduce ``ASGIResponse``
        :pr: 1790
        :breaking:

        Response Containers were wrapper classes used to indicate the type of response
        returned by a handler, for example ``File``, ``Redirect``, ``Template`` and
        ``Stream`` types. These types abstracted the interface of responses from the
        underlying response itself.

        Response containers have been removed and their functionality largely merged with
        that of :class:`~litestar.response.Response`. The predefined response containers
        still exist functionally, as subclasses of
        :class:`Response <.response.Response>` and are now located within the
        :mod:`litestar.response` module.
        In addition to the functionality of Response containers, they now also feature
        all of the response's functionality, such as methods to add headers and cookies.

        The :class:`~litestar.response.Response` class now only serves as a wrapper and
        context object, and does not handle the data sending part, which has been
        delegated to a newly introduced
        :class:`ASGIResponse <.response.base.ASGIResponse>`. This type (and its
        subclasses) represent the response as an immutable object and are used
        internally by Litestar to perform the I/O operations of the response. These can
        be created and returned from handlers like any other ASGI application, however
        they are low-level, and lack the utility of the higher-level response types.

    .. change:: Warn about sync callables in route handlers and dependencies without an explicit ``sync_to_thread`` value
        :type: feature
        :pr: 1648 1655

        A warning will now be raised when a synchronous callable is being used in an
        :class:`~.handlers.HTTPRouteHandler` or :class:`~.di.Provide`, without setting
        ``sync_to_thread``. This is to ensure that synchronous callables are handled
        properly, and to prevent accidentally using callables which might block the main
        thread.

        This warning can be turned off globally by setting the environment variable
        ``LITESTAR_WARN_IMPLICIT_SYNC_TO_THREAD=0``.

        A warning will be raised when ``sync_to_thread`` is being used in
        :class:`~.handlers.HTTPRouteHandler` or :class:`~.di.Provide` with an
        asynchronous callable, as this will have no effect.

    .. change:: WebSockets: Dependencies in listener hooks
        :type: feature

        Dependencies can now be used in the
        :class:`~litestar.handlers.websocket_listener` hooks
        ``on_accept``, ``on_disconnect`` and the ``connection_lifespan`` context
        manager. The ``socket`` parameter is therefore also not mandatory anymore in
        those callables.

    .. change:: Declaring dependencies without ``Provide``
        :type: feature
        :pr: 1647

        Dependencies can now be declared without using :class:`~litestar.di.Provide`.
        The callables can be passed directly to the ``dependencies`` dictionary.


    .. change:: Add ``DTOData`` to receive unstructured but validated DTO data
        :type: feature
        :pr: 1650

        :class:`~litestar.dto.factory.DTOData` is a datastructure for interacting with
        DTO validated data in its unstructured form.

        This utility is to support the case where the amount of data that is available
        from the client request is not complete enough to instantiate an instance of the
        model that would otherwise be injected.


    .. change:: Partial DTOs
        :type: feature
        :pr: 1651

        Add a ``partial`` flag to :class:`~litestar.dto.factory.DTOConfig`, making all
        DTO fields options. Subsequently, any unset values will be filtered when
        extracting data from transfer models.

        This allows for example to use a to handle PATCH requests more easily.


    .. change:: SQLAlchemy repository: ``psycopg`` asyncio support

        tested for the SQLAlchemy repository.

    .. change:: SQLAlchemy repository: ``BigIntPrimaryKey`` mixin
        :type: feature
        :pr: 1657

        ``~litestar.contrib.sqlalchemy.base.BigIntPrimaryKey`` mixin, providing a
        ``BigInt`` primary key column, with a fallback to ``Integer`` for sqlite.

    .. change:: SQLAlchemy repository: Store GUIDs as binary on databases that don't have a native GUID type
        :type: feature
        :pr: 1657

        On databases without native support for GUIDs,
        ``~litestar.contrib.sqlalchemy.types.GUID`` will now fall back to
        ``BINARY(16)``.

    .. change:: Application lifespan context managers
        :type: feature
        :pr: 1635

        A new ``lifespan`` argument has been added to :class:`~litestar.app.Litestar`,
        accepting an asynchronous context manager, wrapping the lifespan of the
        application. It will be entered with the startup phase and exited on shutdown,
        providing functionality equal to the ``on_startup`` and ``on_shutdown`` hooks.

    .. change:: Unify application lifespan hooks: Remove ``before_`` and ``after_``
        :breaking:
        :type: feature
        :pr: 1663

        The following application lifespan hooks have been removed:

        - ``before_startup``
        - ``after_startup``
        - ``before_shutdown``
        - ``after_shutdown``

        The remaining hooks ``on_startup`` and ``on_shutdown`` will now receive as their

        :issue: 1643

        A bug was fixed that would lead to name collisions in the OpenAPI schema when
        using DTOs with the same class name. DTOs now include a short 8 byte random
        string in their generated name to prevent this.

    .. change:: Fix validated attrs model being injected as a dictionary
        :type: bugfix
        :pr: 1668
        :issue: 1643

        A bug was fixed that would lead to an attrs model used to validate a route
        handler's ``data`` not being injected itself but as a dictionary representation.

        :pr: 1626

        Two new methods were added to the :class:`WebSocket <litestar.connection.WebSocket>`
        connection, which allow to continuously receive data and iterate over it:

        - :meth:`iter_data <litestar.connection.WebSocket.iter_data>`
        - :meth:`iter_json <litestar.connection.WebSocket.iter_json>`


    .. change:: WebSockets: MessagePack support
        :type: feature
        :pr: 1626

        Add support for `MessagePack <https://msgpack.org/index.html>`_ to the
        :class:`WebSocket <litestar.connection.WebSocket>` connection.

        Three new methods have been added for handling MessagePack:

        - :meth:`send_msgpack <litestar.connection.WebSocket.send_msgpack>`
        - :meth:`receive_msgpack <litestar.connection.WebSocket.receive_msgpack>`
        - :meth:`iter_msgpack <litestar.connection.WebSocket.iter_msgpack>`

        In addition, two MessagePack related methods were added to
        :class:`WebSocketTestSession <litestar.testing.WebSocketTestSession>`:

        - :meth:`send_msgpack <litestar.testing.WebSocketTestSession.send_msgpack>`
        - :meth:`receive_msgpack <litestar.testing.WebSocketTestSession.receive_msgpack>`

    .. change:: SQLAlchemy repository: Add support for sentinel column
        :type: feature
        :pr: 1603

        This change adds support for ``sentinel column`` feature added in ``sqlalchemy``
        2.0.10. Without it, there are certain cases where ``add_many`` raises an
        exception.

        The ``_sentinel`` value added to the declarative base should be excluded from
        normal select operations automatically and is excluded in the ``to_dict``
        methods.

    .. change:: DTO: Alias generator for field names
        :type: feature
        :pr: 1590

        A new argument ``rename_strategy`` has been added to the :class:`DTOConfig <litestar.dto.factory.DTOConfig>`,
        allowing to remap field names with strategies such as "camelize".

    .. change:: DTO: Nested field exclusion
        :type: feature
        :pr: 1596
        :issue: 1197

        This feature adds support for excluding nested model fields using dot-notation,
        e.g., ``"a.b"`` excludes field ``b`` from nested model field ``a``

    .. change:: WebSockets: Managing a socket's lifespan using a context manager in websocket listeners
        :type: feature
        :pr: 1625

        Changes the way a socket's lifespan - accepting the connection and calling the
        appropriate event hooks - to use a context manager.

        The ``connection_lifespan`` argument was added to the
        :class:`WebSocketListener <litestar.handlers.websocket_listener>`, which accepts
        an asynchronous context manager, which can be used to handle the lifespan of
        the socket.

    .. change:: New module: Channels
        :type: feature
        :pr: 1587

        A new module :doc:`channels </usage/channels>` has been added: A general purpose

        `msgspec <https://jcristharif.com/msgspec/>`_ ``Struct``\ s.

    .. change:: SQLAlchemy repository: Add ``ModelProtocol``
        :type: feature
        :pr: 1503

        Add a new class ``contrib.sqlalchemy.base.ModelProtocol``, serving as a generic model base type, allowing to
        specify custom base classes while preserving typing information

    .. change:: SQLAlchemy repository: Support MySQL/MariaDB
        :type: feature
        :pr: 1345

        Add support for MySQL/MariaDB to the SQLAlchemy repository, using the
        `asyncmy <https://github.com/long2ice/asyncmy>`_ driver.

    .. change:: SQLAlchemy repository: Support MySQL/MariaDB
        :type: feature

        Add support for MySQL/MariaDB to the SQLAlchemy repository, using the
        `asyncmy <https://github.com/long2ice/asyncmy>`_ driver.

    .. change:: SQLAlchemy repository: Add matching logic to ``get_or_create``
        :type: feature
        :pr: 1345

        Add a ``match_fields`` argument to
        ``litestar.contrib.sqlalchemy.repository.SQLAlchemyAsyncRepository.get_or_create``.
        This lets you lookup a model using a subset of the kwargs you've provided. If the remaining kwargs are different
        from the retrieved model's stored values, an update is performed.

    .. change:: Repository: Extend filter types
        :type: feature
        :pr: 1345

        Add new filters ``litestar.contrib.repository.filters.OrderBy`` and
        ``litestar.contrib.repository.filters.SearchFilter``, providing ``ORDER BY ...`` and
        ``LIKE ...`` / ``ILIKE ...`` clauses respectively

    .. change:: SQLAlchemy repository: Rename ``SQLAlchemyRepository`` > ``SQLAlchemyAsyncRepository``
        :breaking:
        :type: misc
        :pr: 1345

        ``SQLAlchemyRepository`` has been renamed to
        ``litestar.contrib.sqlalchemy.repository.SQLAlchemyAsyncRepository``.


    .. change:: DTO: Add ``AbstractDTOFactory`` and backends
        :type: feature
        :pr: 1461

        An all-new DTO implementation was added, using ``AbstractDTOFactory`` as a base class, providing Pydantic and
        msgspec backends to facilitate (de)serialization and validation.

    .. change:: DTO: Remove ``from_connection`` / extend ``from_data``
        :breaking:
        :type: misc
        :pr: 1500

        The method ``DTOInterface.from_connection`` has been removed and replaced by ``DTOInterface.from_bytes``, which
        receives both the raw bytes from the connection, and the connection instance. Since ``from_bytes`` now does not
        handle connections anymore, it can also be a synchronous method, improving symmetry with
        ``DTOInterface.from_bytes``.

        The signature of ``from_data`` has been changed to also accept the connection, matching ``from_bytes``'
        signature.

        As a result of these changes,
        :meth:`DTOInterface.from_bytes <litestar.dto.interface.DTOInterface.data_to_encodable_type>` no longer needs to
        receive the connection instance, so the ``request`` parameter has been dropped.

    .. change:: WebSockets: Support DTOs in listeners
        :type: feature
        :pr: 1518

        Support for DTOs has been added to :class:`WebSocketListener <litestar.handlers.WebsocketListener>` and
        :class:`WebSocketListener <litestar.handlers.websocket_listener>`. A ``dto`` and ``return_dto`` parameter has
        been added, providing the same functionality as their route handler counterparts.

    .. change:: DTO based serialization plugin
        :breaking:
        :type: feature
        :pr: 1501

        :class:`SerializationPluginProtocol <litestar.plugins.SerializationPluginProtocol>` has been re-implemented,
        leveraging the new :class:`DTOInterface <litestar.dto.interface.DTOInterface>`.

        If a handler defines a plugin supported type as either the ``data`` kwarg type annotation, or as the return
        annotation for a handler function, and no DTO has otherwise been resolved to handle the type, the protocol
        creates a DTO implementation to represent that type which is then used to de-serialize into, and serialize from
        instances of that supported type.

        .. important::
            The `Piccolo ORM <https://piccolo-orm.com/>`_ and `Tortoise ORM <https://tortoise.github.io/>`_ plugins have
            been removed by this change, but will be re-implemented using the new patterns in a future release leading
            up to the 2.0 release.

    .. change:: SQLAlchemy 1 contrib module removed
        :breaking:
        :type: misc
        :pr: 1501

        As a result of the changes introduced in `#1501 <https://github.com/litestar-org/litestar/pull/1501>`_,
        SQLAlchemy 1 support has been dropped.

        .. note::
            If you rely on SQLAlchemy 1, you can stick to Starlite *1.51* for now. In the future, a SQLAlchemy 1 plugin
            may be released as a standalone package.

    .. change:: Fix inconsistent parsing of unix timestamp between pydantic and cattrs
        :type: bugfix
        :pr: 1492
        :issue: 1491

        Timestamps parsed as :class:`date <datetime.date>` with pydantic return a UTC date, while cattrs implementation
        return a date with the local timezone.

        This was corrected by forcing dates to UTC when being parsed by attrs.

    .. change:: Fix: Retrieve type hints from class with no ``__init__`` method causes error
        :type: bugfix
        :pr: 1505
        :issue: 1504

        An error would occur when using a callable without an :meth:`object.__init__` method was used in a placed that
        would cause it to be inspected (such as a route handler's signature).

        This was caused by trying to access the ``__module__`` attribute of :meth:`object.__init__`, which would fail
        with

        .. code-block::

            'wrapper_descriptor' object has no attribute '__module__'

    .. change:: Fix error raised for partially installed attrs dependencies
        :type: bugfix
        :pr: 1543

        An error was fixed that would cause a :exc:`MissingDependencyException` to be raised when dependencies for
        `attrs <https://www.attrs.org>`_ were partially installed. This was fixed by being more specific about the
        missing dependencies in the error messages.

    .. change:: Change ``MissingDependencyException`` to be a subclass of ``ImportError``
        :type: misc
        :pr: 1557

        :exc:`MissingDependencyException` is now a subclass of :exc:`ImportError`, to make handling cases where both
        of them might be raised easier.

    .. change:: Remove bool coercion in URL parsing
        :breaking:
        :type: bugfix
        :pr: 1550
        :issue: 1547

        When defining a query parameter as ``param: str``, and passing it a string value of ``"true"``, the value
        received by the route handler was the string ``"True"``, having been title cased. The same was true for the value
        of ``"false"``.

        This has been fixed by removing the coercing of boolean-like values during URL parsing and leaving it up to
        the parsing utilities of the receiving side (i.e. the handler's signature model) to handle these values
        according to the associated type annotations.

    .. change:: Update ``standard`` and ``full`` package extras
        :type: misc
        :pr: 1494

        - Add SQLAlchemy, uvicorn, attrs and structlog to the ``full`` extra
        - Add uvicorn to the ``standard`` extra
        - Add ``uvicorn[standard]`` as an optional dependency to be used in the extras

    .. change:: Remove support for declaring DTOs as handler types
        :breaking:
        :type: misc
        :pr: 1534

        Prior to this, a DTO type could be declared implicitly using type annotations. With the addition of the ``dto``
        and ``return_dto`` parameters, this feature has become superfluous and, in the spirit of offering only one clear
        way of doing things, has been removed.

    .. change:: Fix missing ``content-encoding`` headers on gzip/brotli compressed files
        :type: bugfix
        :pr: 1577
        :issue: 1576

        Fixed a bug that would cause static files served via ``StaticFilesConfig`` that have been compressed with gripz
        or brotli to miss the appropriate ``content-encoding`` header.

    .. change:: DTO: Simplify ``DTOConfig``
        :type: misc
        :breaking:
        :pr: 1580

        - The ``include`` parameter has been removed, to provide a more accessible interface and avoid overly complex
          interplay with ``exclude`` and its support for dotted attributes
        - ``field_mapping`` has been renamed to ``rename_fields`` and support to remap field types has been dropped
        - experimental ``field_definitions`` has been removed. It may be replaced with a "ComputedField" in a future
          release that will allow multiple field definitions to be added to the model, and a callable that transforms
          them into a value for a model field. See

    .. change:: Update logging levels when setting ``Litestar.debug`` dynamically
        :type: bugfix
        :issue: 1476
        :pr: 1482

        When passing ``debug=True`` to :class:`Litestar <litestar.app.Litestar>`, the ``litestar`` logger would be set
        up in debug mode, but changing the ``debug`` attribute after the class had been instantiated did not update the
        logger accordingly.

        This lead to a regression where the ``--debug`` flag to the CLI's ``run`` command would no longer have the
        desired affect, as loggers would still be on the ``INFO`` level.

    .. change:: SQLAlchemy 2.0 Plugin
        :type: feature
        :pr: 1395

        A :class:`SQLAlchemyInitPlugin <litestar.contrib.sqlalchemy.plugins.SQLAlchemyInitPlugin>` was added,
        providing support for managed synchronous and asynchronous sessions.

    .. change:: Support setting status codes in ``Redirect`` container
        :type: feature
        :pr: 1412
        :issue: 1371

        Add support for manually setting status codes in the
        :class:`RedirectResponse <litestar.response_containers.Redirect>` response container.
        This was previously only possible by setting the ``status_code`` parameter on
        the corresponding route handler, making dynamic redirect status codes and
        conditional redirects using this container hard to implement.

    .. change:: Sentinel value to support caching responses indefinitely
        :type: feature
        :pr: 1414
        :issue: 1365

        Add the :class:`CACHE_FOREVER <litestar.config.response_cache.CACHE_FOREVER>` sentinel value, that, when passed
        to a route handlers ``cache argument``, will cause it to be cached forever, skipping the default expiration.

        Additionally, add support for setting
        :attr:`ResponseCacheConfig.default_expiration <litestar.config.response_cache.ResponseCacheConfig>` to ``None``,
        allowing to cache values indefinitely by default when setting ``cache=True`` on a route handler.

    .. change:: `Accept`-header parsing and content negotiation
        :type: feature
        :pr: 1317

        Add an :attr:`accept <litestar.connection.Request.accept>` property to
        :class:`Request <litestar.connection.Request>`, returning the newly added
        :class:`Accept <litestar.datastructures.headers.Accept>` header wrapper, representing the requests ``Accept``
        HTTP header, offering basic content negotiation.

    .. change:: SQLAlchemy 1 plugin mutates app state destructively
        :type: bugfix
        :pr: 1391
        :issue: 1368

        When using the SQLAlchemy 1 plugin, repeatedly running through the application lifecycle (as done when testing
        an application not provided by a factory function), would result in a :exc:`KeyError` on the second pass.

        This was caused be the plugin's ``on_shutdown`` handler deleting the ``engine_app_state_key`` from the
        application's state on application shutdown, but only adding it on application init.

        This was fixed by adding performing the necessary setup actions on application startup rather than init.

        :issue: 1388

        An annotation such as

        .. code-block:: python

            async def provide_user(request: Request[User, Token, Any]) -> User:
                ...

        would result in the error ``'Request' object has no attribute 'dict'``.

        This was fixed by changing how ``get_plugin_for_value`` interacts with :func:`typing.get_args`

    .. change:: Support OpenAPI schema generation with stringized return annotation
        :type: bugfix
        :pr: 1410
        :issue: 1409

        The following code would result in non-specific and incorrect information being generated for the OpenAPI schema:

        .. code-block:: python

            from __future__ import annotations

            from starlite import Starlite, get


            @get("/")
            def hello_world() -> dict[str, str]:
                return {"hello": "world"}

        This could be alleviated by removing ``from __future__ import annotations``. Stringized annotations in any form
        are now fully supported.

    .. change:: Fix OpenAPI schema generation crashes for models with ``Annotated`` type attribute
        :type: bugfix
        :issue: 1372
        :pr: 1400

        When using a model that includes a type annotation with :class:`typing.Annotated` in a route handler, the
        interactive documentation would raise an error when accessed. This has been fixed and :class:`typing.Annotated`
        is now fully supported.

    .. change:: Support empty ``data`` in ``RequestFactory``
        :type: bugfix
        :issue: 1419
        :pr: 1420

        Add support for passing an empty ``data`` parameter to a
        :class:`RequestFactory <litestar.testing.RequestFactory>`, which would previously lead to an error.

        :type: misc
        :pr: 1417

        Add missing parameters to :func:`create_test_client <litestar.testing.create_test_client>` and
        :func:`create_test_client <litestar.testing.create_async_test_client>`. The following parameters were added:

        - ``cache_control``

.. changelog:: 2.0.0alpha2

    .. change:: Repository contrib & SQLAlchemy repository
        :type: feature
        :pr: 1254

        Add a a ``repository`` module to ``contrib``, providing abstract base classes
        to implement the repository pattern. Also added was the ``contrib.repository.sqlalchemy``
        module, implementing a SQLAlchemy repository, offering hand-tuned abstractions
        over commonly used tasks, such as handling of object sessions, inserting,
        updating and upserting individual models or collections.

    .. change:: Data stores & registry
        :type: feature
        :pr: 1330
        :breaking:

        The ``starlite.storage`` module added in the previous version has been
        renamed ``starlite.stores`` to reduce ambiguity, and a new feature, the
        ``starlite.stores.registry.StoreRegistry`` has been introduced;
        It serves as a central place to manage stores and reduces the amount of
        configuration needed for various integrations.

        - Add ``stores`` kwarg to ``Starlite`` and ``AppConfig`` to allow seeding of the ``StoreRegistry``
        - Add ``Starlite.stores`` attribute, containing a ``StoreRegistry``
        - Change ``RateLimitMiddleware`` to use ``app.stores``
        - Change request caching to use ``app.stores``
        - Change server side sessions to use ``app.stores``
        - Move ``starlite.config.cache.CacheConfig`` to  ``starlite.config.response_cache.ResponseCacheConfig``
        - Rename ``Starlite.cache_config`` > ``Starlite.response_cache_config``
        - Rename ``AppConfig.cache_config`` > ``response_cache_config``
        - Remove ``starlite/cache`` module
        - Remove ``ASGIConnection.cache`` property
        - Remove ``Starlite.cache`` attribute

        .. attention::
            ``starlite.middleware.rate_limit.RateLimitMiddleware``,
            ``starlite.config.response_cache.ResponseCacheConfig``,
            and ``starlite.middleware.session.server_side.ServerSideSessionConfig``
            instead of accepting a ``storage`` argument that could be passed a ``Storage`` instance now have to be
            configured via the ``store`` attribute, accepting a string key for the store to be used from the registry.
            The ``store`` attribute has a unique default set, guaranteeing a unique
            ``starlite.stores.memory.MemoryStore`` instance is acquired for every one of them from the
            registry by default

    .. change:: Add ``starlite.__version__``
        :type: feature
        :pr: 1277

        Add a ``__version__`` constant to the ``starlite`` namespace, containing a
        :class:`NamedTuple <typing.NamedTuple>`, holding information about the currently
        installed version of Starlite


    .. change:: Add ``starlite version`` command to CLI
        :type: feature
        :pr: 1322

        Add a new ``version`` command to the CLI which displays the currently installed
        version of Starlite


    .. change:: Enhance CLI autodiscovery logic
        :type: feature
        :breaking:
        :pr: 1322

        Update the CLI :ref:`usage/cli:autodiscovery` to only consider canonical modules app and application, but every
        ``starlite.app.Starlite`` instance or application factory able to return a ``Starlite`` instance within
        those or one of their submodules, giving priority to the canonical names app and application for application
        objects and submodules containing them.

    .. change:: Configurable exception logging and traceback truncation
        :type: feature
        :pr: 1296

        Add three new configuration options to ``starlite.logging.config.BaseLoggingConfig``:

        ``starlite.logging.config.LoggingConfig.log_exceptions``
            Configure when exceptions are logged.

            ``always``
                Always log exceptions

            ``debug``
                Log exceptions in debug mode only

            ``never``
                Never log exception

        ``starlite.logging.config.LoggingConfig.traceback_line_limit``
            Configure how many lines of tracback are logged

        ``starlite.logging.config.LoggingConfig.exception_logging_handler``
            A callable that receives three parameters - the ``app.logger``, the connection scope and the traceback
            list, and should handle logging

    .. change:: Allow overwriting default OpenAPI response descriptions
        :type: bugfix
        :issue: 1292
        :pr: 1293

        Fix https://github.com/litestar-org/litestar/issues/1292 by allowing to overwrite
        the default OpenAPI response description instead of raising :exc:`ImproperlyConfiguredException`.


    .. change:: Fix regression in path resolution that prevented 404's being raised for false paths
        :type: bugfix
        :pr: 1316
        :breaking:

        Invalid paths within controllers would under specific circumstances not raise a 404. This was a regression
        compared to ``v1.51``

        .. note::
            This has been marked as breaking since one user has reported to rely on this "feature"


    .. change:: Fix ``after_request`` hook not being called on responses returned from handlers
        :type: bugfix
        :pr: 1344
        :issue: 1315

        ``after_request`` hooks were not being called automatically when a ``starlite.response.Response``
        instances was returned from a route handler directly.

    .. change:: Fix ``SQLAlchemyPlugin`` raises error when using SQLAlchemy UUID
        :type: bugfix
        :pr: 1355

        An error would be raised when using the SQLAlchemy plugin with a
        `sqlalchemy UUID <https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/20/core/type_basics.html#sqlalchemy.types.UUID>`_. This
        was fixed by adding it to the provider map.


    .. change:: Fix ``JSON.parse`` error in ReDoc and Swagger OpenAPI handlers
        :type: bugfix
        :pr: 1363

        The HTML generated by the ReDoc and Swagger OpenAPI handlers would cause
        `JSON.parse <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/parse>`_
        to throw an error. This was fixed by removing the call to ``JSON.parse``.


    .. change:: Fix CLI prints application info twice
        :type: bugfix
        :pr: 1322

        Fix an error where the CLI would print application info twice on startup


    .. change:: Update ``SimpleEventEmitter`` to use worker pattern
        :type: misc
        :pr: 1346

        ``starlite.events.emitter.SimpleEventEmitter`` was updated to using an async worker, pulling
        emitted events from a queue and subsequently calling listeners. Previously listeners were called immediately,
        making the operation effectively "blocking".


    .. change:: Make ``BaseEventEmitterBackend.emit`` synchronous
        :type: misc
        :breaking:
        :pr: 1376

        ``starlite.events.emitter.BaseEventEmitterBackend``, and subsequently
        ``starlite.events.emitter.SimpleEventEmitter`` and
        ``starlite.app.Starlite.emit`` have been changed to synchronous function, allowing them to easily be
        used within synchronous route handlers.

    .. change:: Remove ``picologging`` dependency from the ``standard`` package extra
        :type: misc
        :breaking:
        :pr: 1313

        `picologging <https://github.com/microsoft/picologging>`_ has been removed form the ``standard`` package extra.
        If you have been previously relying on this, you need to change ``pip install starlite[standard]`` to
        ``pip install starlite[standard,picologging]``


    .. change:: Replace ``Starlite()`` ``initial_state`` keyword argument with ``state``
        :type: misc
        :pr: 1350
        :breaking:

        The ``initial_state`` argument to ``starlite.app.Starlite`` has been replaced with a ``state`` keyword
        argument, accepting an optional ``starlite.datastructures.state.State`` instance.

        Existing code using this keyword argument will need to be changed from

        .. code-block:: python

            from starlite import Starlite

            app = Starlite(..., initial_state={"some": "key"})

        :type: misc
        :pr: 1354
        :breaking:

        ``before_send`` hook handlers initially accepted 2 arguments, but support for a 3 argument form was added

.. changelog:: 2.0.0alpha1

    .. change:: Validation of controller route handler methods
        :type: feature
        :pr: 1144

        Starlite will now validate that no duplicate handlers (that is, they have the same
        path and same method) exist.

    .. change:: HTMX support
        :type: feature
        :pr: 1086

        Basic support for HTMX requests and responses.

    .. change:: Alternate constructor ``Starlite.from_config``
        :type: feature
        :pr: 1190

        ``starlite.app.Starlite.from_config`` was added to the
        ``starlite.app.Starlite`` class which allows to construct an instance
        from an ``starlite.config.app.AppConfig`` instance.

    .. change:: Web concurrency option for CLI ``run`` command
        :pr: 1218
        :type: feature

        A ``--wc`` / --web-concurrency` option was added to the ``starlite run`` command,
        enabling users to specify the amount of worker processes to use. A corresponding
        environment variable ``WEB_CONCURRENCY`` was added as well

    .. change:: Validation of ``state`` parameter in handler functions
        :type: feature
        :pr: 1264

        Type annotations of the reserved ``state`` parameter in handler functions will
        now be validated such that annotations using an unsupported type will raise a
        ``starlite.exceptions.ImproperlyConfiguredException``.

    .. change:: Generic application state
        :type: feature
        :pr: 1030

        ``starlite.connection.base.ASGIConnection`` and its subclasses are now generic on ``State``
        which allow to to fully type hint a request as ``Request[UserType, AuthType, StateType]``.

    .. change:: Dependency injection of classes
        :type: feature
        :pr: 1143

        Support using classes (not class instances, which were already supported) as dependency providers.
        With this, now every callable is supported as a dependency provider.

    .. change:: Event bus
        :pr: 1105
        :type: feature

        A simple event bus system for Starlite, supporting synchronous and asynchronous listeners and emitters, providing a
        similar interface to handlers. It currently features a simple in-memory, process-local backend

    .. change:: Unified storage interfaces
        :type: feature
        :pr: 1184
        :breaking:

        Storage backends for server-side sessions ``starlite.cache.Cache``` have been unified and replaced
        by the ``starlite.storages``, which implements generic asynchronous key/values stores backed
        by memory, the file system or redis.

        .. important::
            This is a breaking change and you need to change your session / cache configuration accordingly


    .. change:: Relaxed type annotations
        :pr: 1140
        :type: misc

        Type annotations across the library have been relaxed to more generic forms, for example
        ``Iterable[str]`` instead of ``List[str]`` or ``Mapping[str, str]`` instead of ``Dict[str, str]``.

    .. change:: ``type_encoders`` support in ``AbstractSecurityConfig``
        :type: misc
        :pr: 1167

        ``type_encoders`` support has been added to
        ``starlite.security.base.AbstractSecurityConfig``, enabling support for customized
        ``type_encoders`` for example in ``starlite.contrib.jwt.jwt_auth.JWTAuth``.


    .. change::  Renamed handler module names
        :type: misc
        :breaking:
        :pr: 1170

        The modules containing route handlers have been renamed to prevent ambiguity between module and handler names.

        - ``starlite.handlers.asgi`` > ``starlite.handlers.asgi_handlers``
        - ``starlite.handlers.http`` > ``starlite.handlers.http_handlers``
        - ``starlite.handlers.websocket`` > ``starlite.handlers.websocket_handlers``


    .. change:: New plugin protocols
        :type: misc
        :pr: 1176
        :breaking:

        The plugin protocol has been split into three distinct protocols, covering different use cases:

        ``starlite.plugins.InitPluginProtocol``
            Hook into an application's initialization process

        ``starlite.plugins.SerializationPluginProtocol``
            Extend the serialization and deserialization capabilities of an application

        ``starlite.plugins.OpenAPISchemaPluginProtocol``
            Extend OpenAPI schema generation


    .. change::  Unify response headers and cookies
        :type: misc
        :breaking:
        :pr: 1209

        :ref:`response headers <usage/responses:Setting Response Headers>` and
        :ref:`response cookies <usage/responses:Setting Response Cookies>` now have the
        same interface, along with the ``headers`` and ``cookies`` keyword arguments to
        ``starlite.response.Response``. They each allow to pass either a
        `:class:`Mapping[str, str] <typing.Mapping>`, e.g. a dictionary, or a :class:`Sequence <typing.Sequence>` of
        ``starlite.datastructures.response_header.ResponseHeader`` or
        ``starlite.datastructures.cookie.Cookie`` respectively.


    .. change:: Replace Pydantic models with dataclasses
        :type: misc
        :breaking:
        :pr: 1242

        Several Pydantic models used for configuration have been replaced with dataclasses or plain classes. This change
        should be mostly non-breaking, unless you relied on those configuration objects being Pydantic models. The changed
        models are:

        - ``starlite.config.allowed_hosts.AllowedHostsConfig``
        - ``starlite.config.app.AppConfig``
        - ``starlite.config.response_cache.ResponseCacheConfig``

    .. change:: SQLAlchemy plugin moved to ``contrib``
        :type: misc
        :breaking:
        :pr: 1252

        The ``SQLAlchemyPlugin` has moved to ``starlite.contrib.sqlalchemy_1.plugin`` and will only be compatible
        with the SQLAlchemy 1.4 release line. The newer SQLAlchemy 2.x releases will be supported by the
        ``contrib.sqlalchemy`` module.


    .. change:: Cleanup of the ``starlite`` namespace
        :type: misc
        :breaking:
        :pr: 1135

        The ``starlite`` namespace has been cleared up, removing many names from it, which now have to be imported from
        their respective submodules individually. This was both done to improve developer experience as well as reduce
        the time it takes to ``import starlite``.

    .. change:: Fix resolving of relative paths in ``StaticFilesConfig``
        :type: bugfix
        :pr: 1256

        Using a relative :class:`pathlib.Path` did not resolve correctly and result in a ``NotFoundException``

    .. change:: Fix ``--reload`` flag to ``starlite run`` not working correctly
        :type: bugfix
        :pr: 1191

        Passing the ``--reload`` flag to the ``starlite run`` command did not work correctly in all circumstances due to an
        issue with uvicorn. This was resolved by invoking uvicorn in a subprocess.


    .. change:: Fix optional types generate incorrect OpenAPI schemas
