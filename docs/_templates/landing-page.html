        <section>
            <h2>Fully featured</h2>
            <p>
                Everything that's needed to build modern APIs, from data serialization and validation
                to websockets, ORM integration, session management, authentication and more
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Fast</h2>
            <p>
                Starlite puts great emphasis on developer experience and performance: It's one of the fastest ASGI
                frameworks and developing with it is just as fast
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>(a)synchronous</h2>
            <p>
                Fully compliant with the ASGI specification, Starlite is asynchronous at heart, but synchronous
                execution is not a second class citizen: Synchronous applications run without performance penalties
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Community driven</h2>
            <p>
                Developed by a community of volunteers, and led by a team of maintainers, Starlite is a community
                project
                at heart
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Opinionated yet flexible</h2>
            <p>
                Developed to encourage best practices, but flexible enough to stay out of your way
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Scalable</h2>
            <p>
                Bottom-up architecture makes it easy to develop modular and decoupled code, allowing applications to
                scale easily, both in development and deployment
            </p>
