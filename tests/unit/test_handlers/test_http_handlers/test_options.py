    # Currently broken. The reason this cannot work reliably is that when auto-creating
    # OPTIONS handlers, we *assume* that it should inherit the configuration of
    # path-adjacent route handlers, e.g. if a route handler is defined on '/', and
    # registered on a router with the path '/one', it would receive the configuration
    # from that router. However, since it is possible to have multiple handlers per
    # path, which can also be registered with different routers, we would still only
    # create one 'OPTIONS' handler for each path, even if multiple routers exist with
    # handlers for that path. In this case, it is unclear which configuration the
    # 'OPTIONS' handler should receive
