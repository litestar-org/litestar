Once the v2 deprecation PR is merged and released:
1. Update PR #4340 description to note that v2 deprecation was added
2. Respond to review comments (see draft responses below)

## Draft PR Comment Responses

### Response to provinzkraut's comment about examples location:

```markdown
Good point about the examples location. Since we're completely removing SQLAlchemy from Litestar, I'll:
1. Remove all examples from `docs/examples/contrib/sqlalchemy/`
2. Remove examples from `docs/examples/plugins/sqlalchemy*`
3. Open an issue/PR in advanced-alchemy to migrate these examples there

This keeps the separation clean - Litestar v3 won't have any SQLAlchemy code or examples.
```

### Response to provinzkraut's comment about deprecation:

```markdown
I've created a separate PR (#[4343]) targeting the v2 branch to add the deprecation warning for `litestar.plugins.sqlalchemy`.
```

### General update comment for PR #4340:

```markdown
Based on review feedback, here's the updated plan:

1. **v2 branch**: Created PR #[4343] to add deprecation warnings for `litestar.plugins.sqlalchemy`
2. **This PR (v3)**: Will update to:
   - Remove all SQLAlchemy examples from docs
   - Fix remaining documentation references to old imports
   - Keep the complete removal of both modules as-is

3. **Advanced-alchemy**: Will open issue/PR to migrate the examples there

This ensures clean separation with proper deprecation path for v2 users.
