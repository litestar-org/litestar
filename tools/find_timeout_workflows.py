workflow runs where tests failed because of timeouts.

    Main function to identify timeout failures.
    
    This script demonstrates the approach to identify timeout failures using
    the GitHub MCP server tools available in the Copilot environment.
    
    The approach:
    1. Query recent workflow runs (past ~100-500 runs)
    2. For each run with conclusion "failure" or "cancelled":
       a. Get the jobs for that run
       b. For jobs that failed, get their logs
       c. Check logs for timeout indicators
    3. Report all runs with timeout failures
    
    Known timeout indicators in logs:
    - "timeout"
    - "timed out"
    - "Operation cancelled"
    - "The runner has received a shutdown signal"
    - "exceeded the timeout"
    - "SIGTERM"
    - "The job running on runner"
    - "has exceeded the maximum execution time"
    
    Known timeout examples from code comments:
    - https://github.com/litestar-org/litestar/actions/runs/5629765460/job/15255093668
    - https://github.com/litestar-org/litestar/actions/runs/5647890525/job/15298927200
    
    To use this script interactively with MCP tools:
    1. Use github-mcp-server-list_workflows to get workflow IDs
    2. Use github-mcp-server-list_workflow_runs to get recent runs
    3. Filter runs by conclusion: "failure" or "cancelled"
    4. Use github-mcp-server-list_workflow_jobs to get jobs
    5. Use github-mcp-server-get_job_logs with failed_only=true for efficiency
    6. Parse logs for timeout indicators
